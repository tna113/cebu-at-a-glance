I was born in Cebu City, Philippines and immigrated to the U.S. when I was nine years old alongside my immediate family. I designed and created this website in order to showcase and pay homage to one of my favorite places on Earth, my hometown ðŸ’ž. It showcases different types of information about Cebu, including popular tourist destinations for people who want to go visit or anyone looking to learn more.</p>
