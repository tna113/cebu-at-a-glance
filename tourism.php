                <p class="text">Cebu's Mactan Airport is located in the city of Lapu-Lapu, minutes away from the island's capital. If you are visiting internationally or from outside of the island, this is where you'll be landing. Popular modes of transportation include
                    taxis, van rentals, jeepneys and tricycles. Jeepneys and tricycles are most common among Cebu's residents as they are ubiquitous and cheap in fare. These are public modes of transportation so you will be sharing rides with others.
                    You could also move around through "habal-habal" which is essentially Uber/Lyft but instead of a car or a van, you're riding on the back of someone's motorcycle. Seems dangerous but people do it!</p>

                <p class="text">Magellan's cross is an important and significant religious landmark within Cebu's majority population. It signifies the propagation of the Roman Catholic faith within the country/island. It is located outside of the Basilica Minore del
                    Santo Niño, a famous basilica dedicated to the religious image of Christ as a child. I've been to the basilica many times, especially with my grandparents. Every year on the 16th of January, there is a huge festival called Sinulog
                    that everyone celebrates in honor of Santo Niño. The Simala Shrine welcomes thousands of visits every year and is located in Simbonga. The Cebu Taoist temple is a place of refuge where Chinese-Filipios can practice their worship.</p>

                    of Mactan Island. Fort San Pedro is the oldest and smallest fort in the Philippiunes, with walls 20 feet tall and 8 feet thick. The Cebu Heritage Monument is a collection of sculptures made out of bronze, brass and steel depicting
                    scenes that shaped Cebu City. The Temple of Leah was created by Teodorico Soriano Adarna as an expression of love towards his beloved wife of 53 years, Leah Villa Albino-Adarna.</p>

                    to stop by Mountain View. The view, truly never gets old. Make sure to visit at night in order to see the expanse of Cebu's night life! Mountain View also features gardens, karaoke bars, swimming pools, restaurants and an tree-top

                    of wearing thin slippers so learn from me and pack accordingly! The Jumalon Butterfly Sanctuary is located within Cebu City and houses many different species of butterflies. A popular attraction is Oslob's Whale Shark watching. Visitors
                    are able to swim next to these gentle creatures while they feed. Botanical gardens are also ubiquitous in Cebu and are highly recommended.</p>

                <p class="text">If you are into shopping, make sure to stop by Ayala Shopping Center in Cebu City and SM Seaside Mega Mall. These malls are huge and most of all, air conditioned! They house many different shops, stores and restaurants. Parking won't be
                    a problem due to above-ground or underground parking garages, depending on the mall. Personally, I like Ayala Shopping Center because it has a big, open and grassy field within its center catered for casual lounging. My favorite part
                    of SM Seaside is its roof-top area, it has lots of bleacher-like seats facing a mountain region. On special occassions, these malls host shows and festival events on a pre-built stage so make sure to stop by during specific holidays.
                    There are also mercados scattered around the area if you want to buy fresh produce, meat and or something locally made.</p>
