        <p class="text">Located in South-East Asia, underneath Taiwan and right above Indonesia is the Philippines: a country made out of more than seven thousand islands. The country is divided into three distinct parts: Luzon (upper third), Visayas (middle third), and Mindanao (lower third). Cebu is part of the Visayan region and is the second most populated city. It's home to more than three million residents. Cebu City, the largest and most populated city in Cebu, is 10 degrees north of the equator thus giving the island a tropical wet and dry climate.</p>
