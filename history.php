        <p class="text">When Spanish explorer Magellan and his crew came across the island in 1521, Lapu-Lapu, the fierce warrior of Cebu, and his combatants fought in the Battle of Mactan. With the Spanish's rule expanding, Roman Catholicism was introduced to
            the natives. Before Cebu's colonization in the year 1569, it was considered the trading port for merchants in China, Thailand, Eastern Indies and Arabian kingdoms. In the year 1898, when Cebu finally declared itself independent from
            Spain, the United States intervened and colonized the country. It would only be years later, in 1946, that Cebu (and the rest of the country) broke free and became completely independent.</p>
