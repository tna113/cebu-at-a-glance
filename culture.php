                <p class="text">The main and primary language of the Philippines is Tagalog. All students within the country have this embedded within their school's lesson plans. The second-most spoken/popular language is Cebuano or Visayan. This originated in Cebu
                    and is estimated to be spoken by around 15.8 million people as their first language. The majority of Cebu's residents are Roman Catholic and as a result, Cebuanos tend to celebrate Catholic holidays, traditions and festivities like
                    Christmas, All Saint's Day, Holy Week, All Soul's Day, Easter, and more.</p>

                    As for deserts and snacks: puto maya and sikwate, bibinka, masareal, ampaw, budbud, pintos, torta, otap, rosquillos and dried mangoes.</p>

                <p class="text">Cebu's economy depends on mostly tourism and the information technology (IT) sector. Specifically, 56% of the island's wealth comes from industry, 36% from services and 8% from agiculture. Since tourism is stimulating a bulk of Cebu's
                    economy, the demand for hotels and resorts are increasing. There are quite a handful of BPOs (Business Process Outsourcing) and most of them are headquartered in Cebu City's IT Park. BPOs call for non-call center work like accounting,
                    legal work, language translation, medical transcription and technical support. Companies like Chase Bank and Facebook are some examples of these businesses.</p>
