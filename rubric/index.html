            <h2>RUBRIC</h2>
            <p>As for content pages, I have made 6 which are as follows: a home page, featuring Cebu's geography, a history page, a culture page, a nature page, a tourism page and an about page. Each page consists of images (some are my own) and self-made
                descriptions. Some of these descriptions reference my own personal experiences. </p><br>
            <p>In addition, I've also created a contact me / feedback page for visitor questions and comments. This page fulfills the rubric explanation. In the footer is a link to a references list, split and organized by page.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Lastly, I have completed the new version of Exercise 3 located within my website's exercises tab. <a href="https://people.rit.edu/ta7384/iste240/exercises/ex3/ex3new.html" class="inlinelink" target="_blank">Here is a direct link</a>. It includes
                radio boxes, check boxes and functions within the javaScript file that checks form values. Though, I do want to state that my site isn't mobile-friendly. I have yet to create different mobile queries. Hopefully soon it will be ready!</p>
